# MindTools

Challenge-Accepted Hackathon, 20-22 April 2018 @ The Informal School of IT - Cluj-Napoca. 


Member of an ad-hoc formed development team, called „MindTools”, we had to develop a web-platform
for a non-profit foundation, which had to gather in one place all events, from foundation's partners, 
for personal and professional development for teenagers, and not only.
